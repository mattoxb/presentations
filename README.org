* My Presentations

This repository is probably not much interest except to me.  Here is where I keep all my org-mode source files to
write presentations of various sorts.

The =watch.sh= script is a /zsh/ script that runs [[https://github.com/mattox-b/latex-autocompile][latex-autocompile]]
[[https://shakebuild.com][shake]] script, which will compile any =slides.tex= into a PDF and name it according to the
directory it is in.  The end of the directory name must be =-slides= for this to be detected.

The =default.nix= installs [[https://pygments.org/][Pygments]] for syntax highlighting.
