* Introduction
** Pro Tip

- Computer programs sometimes last a lot longer than you think!

- Comment your code so the next person to use it will be able to make sense of it.

- You in two years might be the next person!

** Objectives

- Explain the difference between parameters and variables
- Use =sympy= to do symbolic computation in [[class:sc][Python]]
  - Today we'll stick to regular algebra; next time we'll try some calculus.
- Commands to learn:
  - =symbols=
  - Simple Math
  - =simplify=
  - =expand=
  - =together=
  - =solve=
  - =factor=
  - =plot=


* Symbols

** SymPy

- We will use [[https://sympy.org][Sympy]] to do symbolic computation in [[class:sc][Python]]
- Similar goals to, e.g. Mathematica, but....
  - It's free
  - Completely written in Python
  - "Lightweight"

** Getting Started

- You will import =sympy= like any other [[class:sc][Python]] library.

  #+begin_src python
import sympy
  #+end_src
