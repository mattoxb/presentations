* Introduction

** Reminder about Tech Policy and Conversations

- Do not use technological devices during class.
- Avoid side conversations.

** Opening scenario
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: opening
:END:

It is 12:47, and just three minutes left for your office hours.  You have just
finished explaining to a group of students how to compare the structural
properties of oak vs pine in 15th century catapults and their geopolitical
significance from an engineering perspective.  Just then another student comes
in and asks if you can repeat that.  The worst thing is that you know this
student, they work very hard in this class.  Meanwhile another student is
holding their midterm exam and has been waiting for 30 minutes so you can
explain why they got points taken off, and yet another student has been waiting
and is frustrated trying to design their own catapult and says "we're out of
time, can you just give me the answer?"

- Have any of these happened to you?
- How would you handle these things?

** Objectives
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID:       objectives
:END:

- Consider the several purposes of office hours.
- Develop a set of best practices to minimize frustration and maximize learning.
- Consider procedures for on-line office hours.

Office hours serve many purposes: official and unofficial

- Content
  - Extra help explaining material
  - Reviewing feedback from past assignments
  - Clarifying course policies

- Interpersonal
  - Distressed students
  - Life-long friendships

** Some Best practices

- Prepare ahead of time!
  - Be sure you are familiar with the syllabus
  - Review upcoming assignments, because they're going to ask!
- Always be professional
  - Especially with the annoying ones!
  - You don't know the back-story.
- Email
  - You are not a call center operator, but do clarify expectations
  - Use BCC instead of CC
  - Don't send anything by email that you wouldn't post on TikTok!
    - Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) --- Emails can be examined for legal reasons, with an important exception:
    - Don't assume privacy.

** FERPA
- FERPA = Federal Educational Something Privacy Act
- Student information is protected by law.
  - Grades
  - Disability status
  - Disability Resources (DRES) letters - it is best not to ask for details.

- Horror story: once a student took a class but dropped it.  The next semester
 they took it again.  Upon going to office hours, the TA (trying to be friendly)
 said "oh, you're back!"

- Parents are not allowed to ask.

** Mandated Reporter Responsibilities

Two situations
- Student under 18 years old facing abuse
  - https://www.legal.uillinois.edu/services/legal_guidance/child_abuse_and_neglect_mandatory_reporting
- Title IX (Sexual misconduct)
  - https://wecare.illinois.edu/titleix/
- Links will be on Canvas page.

*In an emergency, call 911*

** Mental Health

- You may be the only one who notices.
# - See https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/SAC-Quick-Reference-Guide-to-Working-with-Students-of-Concern.pdf
- See the =Quick-Reference-Guide-to-Working-with-Students-of-Concern.pdf=
  for some resources. (On Canvas)

*Again, in an emergency, call 911*

** Online Office Hours

 - Use breakout rooms to preserve privacy (or use the waiting room).
 - It's best to share your video, but do *not* ask students to do so.
 - Use a different zoom link than what you use for the class.
 - Definitely require authentication
 - Online office hours are likely to persist post-COVID.

* Scenarios
** Scenarios

*** Scenario 1

A student comes in after the latest midterm and complains that the exam was too hard.
You assume that they just didn't study enough, but 10 more students come in and report the
same thing.

*** Scenario 2

A student is struggling with an assignment and has started to become impatient.
They want to do well in the class, but office hours is nearly over.
One student shows you a horribly wrong answer and asks, "Is this right?"  Another asks loudly, "Did you even *do* this assignment?"

*** Scenario 3

A student from Nsquardia is in your office hours, along with another student from Nlognia.  The student from Nsquardia
comments that "everybody knows that people from Nlognia are lazy."

** Homework!

- There is a reflection homework posted to Canvas.
- Due in two weeks!
- Note: these scenarios and reflections are excellent source material for interviews and teaching statements!
  - E.g.: "tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult situation..."
