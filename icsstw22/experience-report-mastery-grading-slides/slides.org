* The Problem with Points

Problem 1 --- Points do not measure learning!

Consider a course with 2 midterms and a final, each with 10 problems.  Four students get a B in your class.


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Student 1: Got 8/10 problems right on each midterm and on the final.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Student 2: Missed midterm 1 but got 100% on midterm 2 and the final.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Student 3: Got 60% partial credit on half the problems, but full credit on the rest.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Student 4: Got full credit on the midterms but 100% on half the problems in the final due to poor internet connection.

How would you characterize the learning of these students?
- Is a B accurate for any of these students?

Problem 2 --- Points devalue learning
- How do typical students prepare for a final exam?
  - "I need to learn x,y, and z to get the grade I want?" or..
  - "I need to score x points to get the grade I want?"
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- How do typical students ask for a regrade?
  - "I really do know this; let me show you!"
  - "Can't I just have 2 more points on this problem?"
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- How do we cover for ourselves when we mess up?
  - "Let me give you another chance to show your knowledge."
  - "Let me give everyone points for that messed up problem."

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Points become the focus, a currency subject to trading and negotiation.

Problem 3 --- Points are inequitable

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
  * Assume a uniform distribution of student background.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
  * Assume a uniform experience of students on campus.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
  * Extra credit opportunities can make this worse.

:END:

- Started using the Nice British System.
  - Final exam score would replace midterm scores.
  - e.g. $s_{mt1} = max(s_{mt1},s_{final})$
  - It's one way only.  (Someone always asks!)

- With Prairielearn, I could do this by section!
  - E.g., recursion section on the final could replace the recursion section on
    midterm 1.

* One Alternative --- Mastery Grading

:END:

Common characteristics:

- Credit is only given for "competency" level of achievement.
  - Usually a "B" level
- Multiple attempts are allowed per assessment
  - Sometimes there are limits or tokens to spend
  - (See [cite:@nilson2015])
- Assessments are often "bundled".
- Grade depends on the number of bundles or outcomes achieved, not necessarily number of problems solved.


* Case Study: CS 421
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       674440ab-f6df-4670-abb2-9e8918e99f08
:END:

- "Medium" sized class of 400
- Mostly seniors, some juniors and grad students
- Required for CS bachelors, often taken in the last semester.
- I teach the language [[class:sc][Haskell]], often the first functional programming language our students have seen extensively.

* Attempt 1 --- Fall 2021
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       83616210-b0ac-461c-821b-13657dd14b37
:END:

- Step 1 --- Wrote down all the learning outcomes and categorized them into 20 "learning modules"

Example: Learning Module 1 --- Recursion
  - Outcomes
    - 1.1)  Write a recursive function over integers (2 points)
    - 1.2)  Write a mapping recursion over lists (2 points)
    - 1.3)  Write a folding recursion over lists (2 points)
    - 1.4)  Write a tail recursive function (2 points)
    - 1.5)  Indicate the advantage of tail recursion over direct style (MC) (2 points)

* Attempt 1, ctd
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       adcfd6e2-fc98-42f7-b2d7-b1c15a6e6da1
:END:

- Step 2 --- Decide which assessments fulfill various outcomes.

- Example: Outcome 1.4  Write a tail recursive function (2 points)
  - Activity 1 (1 point)
  - Exam 1, problem 3 (1 point)
  - MP 3, part 1 (1 point)
  - Final Exam, problem 3 (1 point)

- Multiple assessments could contribute to fulfilling an outcome.
  - Assessments allowed for multiple attempts, but no partial credit.

* Attempt 1, grading scheme
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       75b039fb-eb28-4cfa-a39b-a2f3b70d5e27
:END:

- A learning module (LM) was completed at 8/10 points.
- Grade consists of number of learning modules and machine problems (MPs) completed.
  - 18/20 LMs, 5/6 MPs = A
  - 16/20 LMs, 4/6 MPs = B
- A plus decoration was given for mis-matched levels.
  - E.g., 18 LMs but 4 MPs would be a B+.

* Attempt 2 -- Spring 2022
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7648b631-7f87-4e54-bd26-87f4d5741c91
:END:

- The concept of LMs was perpetually confusing, so:
- Instead of counting learning modules, we counted the points of the outcomes.
  - Each LM already had 10 points, so 180 points out of 200 was an A.
  - Looks more like a traditional grading system.
  - Mastery elements still retained.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Instructor horror: 1/3 of the outcomes were not being measured at all!
  - This is common in a points-based economy where exams are a "stratified sample".
  - Developed many new assessments to measure outcomes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Student reaction mixed
  - "The ones who got it"
    - "I feel like I'm studying to learn now."
    - "I know exactly what I need to study for the final"
    - Reported much reduced stress
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
  - "The others"
    - Uncertainty / unfamiliarity added to stress
    - "Where are the learning modules?"

* Results, crd.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c9180d56-858e-43cd-a142-9285f4d7b981
:END:
- Other Outcomes
  - Only 1 "point negotiation conversation" in two semesters.
  - Sudden exodus after 10th learning module was completed!
  - Grade distribution?
  - Letters of recommendation are easier.
    - Before: "they got an A"
    - Now: "they demonstrated mastery in 18 of the 20 topics"

* Plan for Next Iteration (Subject to Change!)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1d2ee9be-4198-430f-a4f5-6734943465c4
:END:

- Will simplify assignment structure
  - Long HW with multiple problems
  - Single exam problem to verify learning

Example: recursion problem
- Homework will have three problems randomly selected from 10 or so.
- Student passes when they get all three problems, gets three new ones otherwise
- Single recursion problem on exam 1 and the final.

- Will keep "learning modules" as a organizational principle only.

* Lessons Learned
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9393c5e4-a9d9-4e69-a651-950cf16d21e9
:END:

- Conversion is time consuming.
- Make sure communication is clear.
- Students tend to buy in once they understand the system.
  - And they tend to request it in future semesters.
- Grades are much more meaningful.
- Motivating survey participation is harder.  You can't pay them in points for participating!
